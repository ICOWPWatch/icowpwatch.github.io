This is the ICO White Paper Watch website

## Purpose

This site provides a crowdsourced list of known or published white papers that accompany fundraising via blockchain token issuance, a process commonly known as an ICO. Contributions are provided as pull requests to the project, which, once confirmed, will be merged into the project.

White papers are authored ostensibly by the blockchain project's team. It is intended to describe concisely the technical reasoning behind the implementation of the blockchain for that project. However, there are those who argue that the paper has become little more than marketing copy for a project's pending ICO.

The use of white papers describing the function of a cryptocurrency blockchain started with Staoshi Nakamoto's seminal publication for Bitcoin \(see [BitCoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) \). Ethereum issued a [White Paper](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper), and later followed it up with a [Yellow Paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf). In both cases, each project published technically rigorous descriptions of their proposed implementations.

The term "White Paper" used here is therefore a catch-all, used to cover any "color" paper used to describe a blockchain implementation for the purpose of token issuance. "ICO" is an acronym for Initial Coin Offering, the process of raising funds for a project in exchange for new cryptocurrency blockchain tokens. 

## How to Add Information

( steps contributors should take to post new or corrected information. Consider making different sections for each.)

## Initial Metadata

While a repository of ICO white papers are useful in itself, contextual information serves to enhance the user's experience. Below are the initial data to be collected. The only REQUIRED data is **_Paper_Link_**

*Project_Name:* \[ Current Known Name \(prior name, ..., prior name \) | \(Unknown\)\ ]

*Project_Site:* project site resource locator \(url\)

*Coin_TID:* The coin's short ticker name

*Paper_Link:* current resource locator to the white paper

*Original_Paper_Link:* original resource locator to the white paper \(if known\)

*Local_Paper_Link:* resource locator to the white paper in this repository

Additional details, such as the date the project commenced, the dates the ICO launched and ended, the ICO sale price, the name of the members of the team, etc. would be invaluable for developing greater insight into these projects.
